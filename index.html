               This article explores how the staged combustion cycle used in the RS-25 engines helped develop 
               the Space Shuttle into a partially reusable rocket-launched vehicle. Using a staged combustion 
               cycle allowed the Space Shuttle engines to effectively use 62,300 gallons of fuel per minute during
               its ascent (Space Shuttle Propulsion Systems, 2005). Staged combustion cycles are advantageous as
               they use all their propellants in the main combustion chamber. This design allows for high fuel 
               efficiency and higher thrust levels of 1.2 million pounds of thrust during
               liftoff (History of the Space Shuttle Main Engines, no date).

  <pre>  
              The RS-25 is a liquid-fuel cryogenic rocket engine that burns liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen as propellants.
              It was built in the United States by Rocketdyne, with development beginning around the 1970s (Terry, 2025).
              The Space Shuttle utilised a cluster of three RS-25 engines, which were used for propulsion during ascent. A 
              staged combustion cycle is a combustion technique in which the fuel and oxidiser are partially burned in separate 
              stages before being combined and ignited in the main combustion chamber. While early rockets relied on gas generator
              cycles, the Space Shuttle utilised a staged combustion cycle. Traditional gas generator cycles offered reliability 
              but suffered from incomplete fuel combustion and lower thrust levels. It was decided that the RS-25 engines would
              use staged combustion rather than gas generator cycles due to the higher thrust levels of 2279kN compared to 1000kN
              of a typical gas generator cycle. Staged combustion cycle engines are also reusable, and designed for 100s of uses
              after inspection and refurbishment, which highly suited the Space Shuttle's needs.

           A liquid fuel and a liquid oxidiser are drawn from separate tanks. The propellants first pass through small booster pumps, 
           they are then fed into the more powerful turbopumps. Cold fuel wraps around the main combustion chamber and nozzles to
           prevent overheating. This is also known as “regenerative cooling”. 

          The propellants then proceed to a separate, smaller combustion chamber called the preburner. In the preburner, a large 
          portion of the fuel and a small portion of the oxidizer are mixed and ignited. This is a fuel-rich mixture, meaning there
          is an excess of fuel relative to the oxidizer. This partial combustion creates a high-pressure, hot gas. This hot, high-pressure
          gas from the preburner is routed to a turbine. The expansion of the gas spins the turbine at very high speeds. The turbine is
          connected by a shaft to the main turbopumps. This provides the power needed to drive the pumps that force more propellant into
          the engine, creating a self-sustaining cycle. The hot, fuel-rich exhaust gas from the turbine is injected into the main
          combustion chamber. At the same time, the remaining oxidizer that bypassed the preburner is also injected into the main combustion
          chamber. The fuel-rich preburner gas and the remaining oxidizer mix and ignite, undergoing complete combustion. This creates 
          thrust, propelling the rocket forward according to Newton's third law.

      </p>  
        
<p class="ex1">
<pre>
        The staged combustion cycle enables more complete combustion of propellants, resulting in a higher specific impulse of 452 seconds
        (Katherine P. Van Hooser, 2011). This means that the engine can produce more thrust for the same amount of fuel, making it more efficient.
        By operating at a higher chamber pressure, the RS-25 minimised the overall volume and weight of the engine. This was crucial for the
        design of the Space Shuttle, as it needed to carry heavy payloads into orbit. Additionally, the staged combustion cycle offers greater
        flexibility in engine design and operation. The flow rates of the fuel and oxidiser can be adjusted to optimise performance and 
        efficiency, making it suitable for a wide range of propulsion systems.

        The table above highlights the differences between a staged combustion cycle and solid rocket engines.
        Data shows that staged combustion cycle engines have greater performance and safety, which is why Rocketdyne
        decided to use a staged combustion cycle for their RS-25 engines.
