               This article explores how the staged combustion cycle used in the RS-25 engines helped develop the Space Shuttle into
               a partially reusable rocket-launched vehicle. Using a staged combustion cycle allowed the Space Shuttle engines to
               effectively use 62,300 gallons of fuel per minute during its ascent (Space Shuttle Propulsion Systems, 2005). Staged 
               combustion cycles are advantageous as they use all their propellants in the main combustion chamber. This design allows
               for high fuel efficiency and higher thrust levels of 1.2 million pounds of thrust during liftoff (History of the Space 
               Shuttle Main Engines, no date).

               The RS-25 is a liquid-fuel cryogenic rocket engine that burns liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen as propellants. It was 
               built in the United States by Rocketdyne, with development beginning around the 1970s (Terry, 2025). The Space Shuttle
               utilised a cluster of three RS-25 engines, which were used for propulsion during ascent. A staged combustion cycle is 
               a combustion technique in which the fuel and oxidiser are partially burned in separate stages before being combined and
               ignited in the main combustion chamber. While early rockets relied on gas generator cycles, the Space Shuttle utilised
               a staged combustion cycle. Traditional gas generator cycles offered reliability but suffered from incomplete fuel 
               combustion and lower thrust levels. It was decided that the RS-25 engines would use staged combustion rather than gas
               generator cycles due to the higher thrust levels of 2279kN compared to 1000kN of a typical gas generator cycle. Staged
               combustion cycle engines are also reusable, and designed for 100s of uses after inspection and refurbishment, which highly
               suited the Space Shuttle's needs.

               A liquid fuel and a liquid oxidiser are drawn from separate tanks. The propellants first pass through small booster pumps, 
               they are then fed into the more powerful turbopumps. Cold fuel wraps around the main combustion chamber and nozzles to
               prevent overheating. This is also known as “regenerative cooling”. 

               The propellants then proceed to a separate, smaller combustion chamber called the preburner. In the preburner, a large 
               portion of the fuel and a small portion of the oxidizer are mixed and ignited. This is a fuel-rich mixture, meaning there
               is an excess of fuel relative to the oxidizer. This partial combustion creates a high-pressure, hot gas. This hot, high-pressure
               gas from the preburner is routed to a turbine. The expansion of the gas spins the turbine at very high speeds. A shaft connects
               the turbine to the main turbopumps. This provides the power needed to drive the pumps that force more propellant into
               the engine, creating a self-sustaining cycle. The hot, fuel-rich exhaust gas from the turbine is injected into the main
               combustion chamber. At the same time, the remaining oxidizer that bypassed the preburner is also injected into the main
               combustion chamber. The fuel-rich preburner gas and the remaining oxidizer mix and ignite, undergoing complete combustion. 
               This creates thrust, propelling the rocket forward according to Newton's third law.

               The staged combustion cycle enables more complete combustion of propellants, resulting in a higher specific impulse of 452
               seconds (Katherine P. Van Hooser, 2011). This means that the engine can produce more thrust for the same amount of fuel, 
               making it more efficient. By operating at a higher chamber pressure, the RS-25 minimised the overall volume and weight of 
               the engine. This was crucial for the design of the Space Shuttle, as it needed to carry heavy payloads into orbit. Additionally,
               the staged combustion cycle offers greater flexibility in engine design and operation. The flow rates of the fuel and oxidiser
               can be adjusted to optimise performance and efficiency, making it suitable for a wide range of propulsion systems. Staged 
               combustion cycle engines are reusable due to the use of robust materials and thermal protections. On the RS-25 engine, 
               critical systems, such as the valves and pre-burners, were designed with tight tolerances and advanced sealing systems capable
               of handling temperatures of 3315°C (Terry, 2025) in the main combustion chamber.

      </p>  

<p class="ex1">
<pre>       
               One of the main challenges is the complexity of the system. The multiple stages of combustion and the need for separate 
               preburners and turbines can make the engine more difficult to design, build, and maintain. Staged combustion engines 
               have extreme operating conditions which increases the failure from high-pressure components and combustion instabilities.
               Another disadvantage is the high development and manufacturing costs due to the intricate design of the staged combustion
               cycle. This makes the engines more expensive compared to simpler cycles like a gas-generator cycle.

                      The table above highlights the differences between a staged combustion cycle
                      and solid rocket engines. Data shows that staged combustion cycle engines 
                      have greater performance and safety, which is why Rocketdyne decided to use
                      a staged combustion cycle for their RS-25 engines.
