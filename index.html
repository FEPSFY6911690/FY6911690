This article examines how the staged combustion cycle employed in the RS-25 engines contributed to the development of 
the Space Shuttle into a partially reusable rocket-launched vehicle. Using a staged combustion cycle, the Space Shuttle
engines were able to effectively utilize 62,300 gallons of fuel per minute during their ascent (Space Shuttle Propulsion
Systems, 2005). Staged combustion cycles are advantageous as they use all their propellants in the main combustion 
chamber. This design enables high fuel efficiency and allows for higher thrust levels of 1.2 million pounds during 
liftoff (History of the Space Shuttle Main Engines, no date).

The RS-25 is a liquid-fuel cryogenic rocket engine that burns liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen as propellants. It was
built in the United States by Rocketdyne, with development beginning around the 1970s (Terry, 2025). The Space Shuttle
utilised a cluster of three RS-25 engines, which were used for propulsion during ascent. A staged combustion cycle is
a combustion technique in which the fuel and oxidiser are partially burned in separate stages before being combined and
ignited in the main combustion chamber. While early rockets relied on gas generator cycles, the Space Shuttle utilised
a staged combustion cycle. Traditional gas generator cycles offered reliability but suffered from incomplete fuel 
combustion and lower thrust levels. It was decided that the RS-25 engines would use staged combustion rather than gas 
generator cycles due to the higher thrust levels of 2279kN compared to 1000kN of a typical gas generator cycle. Staged
combustion cycle engines are also reusable, and designed for 100s of uses after inspection and refurbishment, which 
highly suits the space shuttle’s needs.

<pre style="font-family: Times New Roman, sans-serif; font-size: 18px;" id="How-does-a-staged-combustion-cycle-work?">
   
A liquid fuel (such as liquid hydrogen) and a liquid oxidiser (such as liquid oxygen, which helps the fuel burn) are 
drawn from separate tanks. The propellants first pass through small booster pumps, and they are then fed into the more
powerful turbopumps. Cold fuel circulates around the main combustion chamber and nozzles, a process called "regenerative
cooling", which prevents engine overheating (Katherine P. Van Hooser, 2011).

The propellants then proceed to a separate, smaller combustion chamber called the preburner. In the preburner, a large
portion of the fuel and a small portion of the oxidiser are mixed and ignited. This is a fuel-rich mixture, meaning 
there is an excess of fuel relative to the oxidiser. This partial combustion creates a high-pressure, hot gas. This hot,
high-pressure gas from the preburner is routed to a turbine. The expansion of the gas spins the turbine at very high 
speeds. The turbine is connected to the main turbopumps via a shaft. This provides the power needed to drive the pumps
that force more propellant into the engine, creating a self-sustaining cycle (Space Shuttle Propulsion Systems, 2005).
The hot, fuel-rich exhaust gas from the turbine is injected into the main combustion chamber. At the same time, the 
remaining oxidiser that bypassed the preburner is also injected into the main combustion chamber. The fuel-rich preburner
gas and the remaining oxidiser mix and ignite, undergoing complete combustion (Terry, 2025). This creates thrust, 
propelling the rocket forward according to Newton's third law.

<pre style="font-family: Times New Roman, sans-serif; font-size: 18px;" id="Advantages-of-a-staged-combustion-cycle">
   
The staged combustion cycle enables more complete combustion of propellants, resulting in a higher specific impulse of
452 seconds (Katherine P. Van Hooser, 2011). This means that the engine can produce more thrust for the same amount of
fuel, making it more efficient. By operating at a higher chamber pressure, the RS-25 minimised the overall volume and
weight of the engine. This was crucial for the design of the Space Shuttle, as it needed to carry heavy payloads into
orbit. Additionally, the staged combustion cycle offers greater flexibility in engine design and operation. The flow 
rates of the fuel and oxidiser can be adjusted to optimise performance and efficiency, making it suitable for a wide 
range of propulsion systems. Staged combustion cycle engines are reusable due to the use of robust materials and thermal
protection. On the RS-25 engine, critical systems, such as the valves and pre-burners, were designed with tight tolerances
and advanced sealing systems capable of handling temperatures of 3315°C (Terry, 2025) in the main combustion chamber. 
This helped prevent damage to the engine and allowed for reusability. A total of 46 RS-25 engines, each costing around
$40 million, were flown during the Space Shuttle Program. This shows that reusability was a large part of the program 
and helped reduce the costs of the engines.

<h3 style="font-family: Times New Roman, sans-serif; font-weight: bold; id="Engineering-challenges-of-the-RS-25">Engineering challenges of the RS-25</h3>  
<pre style="font-family: Times New Roman, sans-serif; font-size: 18px;" id="Engineering-challenges-of-the-RS-25">  
One of the primary challenges is the system's complexity. The multiple stages of combustion and the need for separate 
preburners and turbines can make the engine more difficult to design, build, and maintain. Staged combustion engines
operate under extreme conditions, which can lead to increased failure of high-pressure components and combustion 
instabilities. Another disadvantage is the high development and manufacturing costs due to the intricate design of the
staged combustion cycle. This makes the engines more expensive compared to simpler cycles, such as a gas-generator cycle.

The table above highlights the differences between a staged combustion cycle
and solid rocket engines. Data shows that staged combustion cycle engines 
have greater performance and safety, which is why Rocketdyne decided to use
a staged combustion cycle for their RS-25 engines.

<h3 style="font-family: Times New Roman, sans-serif; font-weight: bold; id="Conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<pre style="font-family: Times New Roman, sans-serif; font-size: 18px;" id="Conclusion">    
By mastering staged combustion cycles, engineers have not only improved performance but also reimagined the limits of
rocket design. By maximising propellant usage, it enables the Space Shuttle engines to operate at higher specific 
impulses and have higher thrust-to-weight ratios - critical for its launch system. Although the design requires 
advanced materials and complex manufacturing, the advantages outweigh this and are shown in the RS-25 engine, which
shows a pivotal advancement from traditional gas generator cycles. Engineers have not only solved a thermodynamic 
challenge but have also created a high-performance, reusable engine cycle that can pave the way for future advanced engines.
