<pre style="font-family: Times New Roman, sans-serif; font-size: 18px;" id="Abstract">
This article explores how the staged combustion cycle employed in the RS-25 engines contributed to the development of the space shuttle into
a partially reusable rocket-launched vehicle. Using a staged combustion cycle, the space shuttle engines were able to operate during the 
entire eight-and-one-half-minute ride to orbit whilst maximising fuel efficiency (Space Shuttle Propulsion Systems, 2005). Staged combustion
cycles are advantageous as they use all their propellants in the main combustion chamber. This design delivered thrust levels of 1.2 million
pounds during liftoff, whilst also supporting reusability (History of the Space Shuttle Main Engines, no date). Although the cycle is complex,
the RS-25 demonstrated how staged combustion could combine efficiency, high thrust, and durability.

<pre style="font-family: Times New Roman, sans-serif; font-size: 18px;" id="Introduction">
The RS-25 is a liquid-fuel cryogenic rocket engine that burns liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen as propellants. It was built in the United 
States by Rocketdyne, with development beginning around the 1970s. The space shuttle utilised a cluster of three RS-25 engines, which were 
used for propulsion during ascent. While early rockets relied on gas generator cycles, the space shuttle utilised a staged combustion cycle.
A staged combustion cycle is a combustion technique in which the fuel and oxidiser are partially burned in separate stages before being 
combined and ignited in the main combustion chamber. Traditional gas generator cycles offered reliability but suffered from incomplete fuel
combustion and lower thrust levels. By contrast, staged combustion enabled the RS‑25 to achieve a specific impulse of 452 seconds, significantly
higher than a gas generator engine (RS-25 PROPULSION SYSTEM). Staged combustion cycle engines are also reusable and designed for 100s 
of uses after inspection and refurbishment, which aligned with the Shuttle’s operational requirements.

<pre style="font-family: Times New Roman, sans-serif; font-size: 18px;" id="How-does-a-staged-combustion-cycle-work?">
A liquid fuel (such as liquid hydrogen) and a liquid oxidiser (such as liquid oxygen, which helps the fuel burn) are drawn from separate tanks.
The propellants first pass through small booster pumps, and they are then fed into the more powerful turbopumps. Cold fuel circulates around
the main combustion chamber and nozzles, a process called "regenerative cooling", which prevents engine overheating (Katherine P. Van Hooser,
2011).

The propellants then proceed to a separate, smaller combustion chamber called the preburner. In the preburner, a large portion of the fuel 
and a small portion of the oxidiser are mixed and ignited. This is a fuel-rich mixture, meaning there is an excess of fuel relative to the 
oxidiser. This partial combustion creates a high-pressure, hot gas. This hot, high-pressure gas from the preburner is routed to a turbine. 
The expansion of the gas spins the turbine at very high speeds. The turbine is connected to the main turbopumps via a shaft. This provides
the power needed to drive the pumps that force more propellant into the engine, creating a self-sustaining cycle (Space Shuttle Propulsion 
Systems, 2005). The hot, fuel-rich exhaust gas from the turbine is injected into the main combustion chamber. At the same time, the remaining
oxidiser that bypassed the preburner is also injected into the main combustion chamber. The fuel-rich preburner gas and the remaining oxidiser
mix and ignite, undergoing complete combustion. This creates thrust, propelling the rocket forward according to Newton's third law.

<pre style="font-family: Times New Roman, sans-serif; font-size: 18px;" id="Advantages-of-a-staged-combustion-cycle">
The staged combustion cycle enables more complete combustion of propellants, resulting in a higher specific impulse of 452 seconds (Katherine
P. Van Hooser, 2011). This means that the engine can produce more thrust for the same amount of fuel, making it more efficient. By operating
at a higher chamber pressure, the RS-25 minimised the overall volume and weight of the engine. This was crucial for the design of the Space
Shuttle, as it needed to carry heavy payloads into orbit. Additionally, the staged combustion cycle offers greater flexibility in engine design
and operation. The flow rates of the fuel and oxidiser can be adjusted to optimise performance and efficiency, making it suitable for a wide 
range of propulsion systems. Staged combustion cycle engines are reusable due to the use of robust materials and thermal protection. On the 
RS-25 engine, critical systems, such as the valves and pre-burners, were designed with tight tolerances and advanced sealing systems capable 
of handling high temperatures in the main combustion chamber. This helped prevent damage to the engine and allowed for reusability. A total 
of 46 RS-25 engines, each costing around $40 million, were flown during the Space Shuttle Program. This shows that reusability was a large 
part of the program and helped reduce the costs of the engines.

<pre style="font-family: Times New Roman, sans-serif; font-size: 18px;" id="Engineering-challenges-of-the-RS-25">
One of the primary challenges is the system's complexity. The multiple stages of combustion and the need for separate preburners and turbines
can make the engine more difficult to design, build, and maintain. Staged combustion engines operate under extreme conditions, which can lead
to increased failure of high-pressure components and combustion instabilities. Another disadvantage is the high development and manufacturing
costs due to the intricate design of the staged combustion cycle. This makes the engines more expensive compared to simpler cycles, such as a
gas-generator cycle.

The table above highlights the differences between a staged combustion cycle and a gas generator cycle. Gas generator cycles prioritise 
reliability and ease of operation by venting turbine exhaust. However, this reduces efficiency as propellant is wasted. In contrast, staged
combustion cycle engines have increased efficiency due to all the propellant being used. This makes them ideal for missions where 
reusability is essential, though the extreme temperatures involved can pose safety risks. Rocketdyne chose the staged combustion cycle for
the RS-25 because the shuttle required maximum efficiency to deliver payloads to orbit.

<h3 style="font-family: Times New Roman, sans-serif; font-weight: bold; id="Conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<pre style="font-family: Times New Roman, sans-serif; font-size: 18px;" id="Conclusion">
By mastering staged combustion cycles, engineers have not only improved performance but also reimagined the limits of rocket design. By 
maximising propellant usage, it enables the Space Shuttle engines to operate at higher specific impulses and have higher thrust-to-weight
ratios - critical for its launch system. Although the design requires advanced materials and complex manufacturing, the advantages outweigh
this and are evident in the RS-25 engine, which shows a pivotal advancement from traditional gas generator cycles. Engineers have not only
solved a thermodynamic challenge but have also created a high-performance, reusable engine cycle that can pave the way for future advanced
engines.
